    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function.</li>
        <li>Combine salt, marjoram, rosemary, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and paprika in a small bowl. Rub mixture all over roast to coat all sides.</li>
        <li>Drizzle oil into the preheated pot. Wait 30 seconds, then place roast into the pot; do not move the meat, allowing it to sear for 3 or 4 minutes. Turn the roast and sear again, 3 to 4 minutes. Repeat until all sides are browned, about 15 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes, carrots, and onion to the pot. Pour in broth and Worcestershire sauce. Close and lock the lid; set vent to sealing. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 60 minutes for a 3-pound roast or 80 minutes for a 5-pound roast. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Transfer roast, potatoes, carrots, and onions to a platter for serving.</li>
    </ol>
